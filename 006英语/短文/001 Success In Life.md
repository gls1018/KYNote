## 1. Success In Life

​	Success means different things for different people, Some may equate it with fume, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments. For me it means fulfilling one's dreams, Whatever your dreams are, you have a goal there and then foucs all your attention on it.

​	Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process struggling for it, you cry, sweat, complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through. So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that undergone the bitterest odeal.

​	There several keys to success,  First,  your goal must be practical and practicable, If you set your goal to high,  chances are that you will never attain it. Next, you have to make a plain of doing it. You can take some steps to realize it, Since the process is quite tough, you need to be diligent, patient and persevering.

​	Even if you meet some difficulties or frustrations, just take them in your stride. You can always tell yourself that there is nothing insurmountable. With this will and determination, success is sure to wait for you at the end of tunnel !
